            In this project I created a turn/grid based game where the player has to move
            across the grid, talking to the blue npcs and completing quests for them. <br />

            This was a solo project and was made using
            <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a>.<br />

            For this project I implemented the A* algorithm for pathfinding across the
            grid and I also had to create an algorithm for procedurally generating the
            quests.

            In this project I made a basic card game where the player plays their
            cards then the enemy will hit the player on their turn. The player
            has to press R on their keyboard to end their turn. This is a left over
            from when it meant R for Reset Hand and I never changed it.<br />

            This was a solo project and was made using

        Link to game: <a href="https://raw.githack.com/xfactory2442/Idle_Game/master/Idle%20Game%20Maybe/MainPage.htm">HTML Game</a>
        <br />
        <p>
            This project is the first time I'm messing around with HTML/JavaScript. The game is a 
            very early version of an incremental/idle game cause those work well for what I
            was trying to learn. <br />
            The player starts out with one button to press and two
            tabs and as they play the game they unlock more options for buttons. <br />
            The player can also change the colour of all of the buttons which I added
            1) because of colour blind people who might look at it and 2) because I wanted
            to figure out how to change the style of something using JavaScript.
